A web page will pop up which contains users clicks and a button to increase clicks.
There are 3 settings which can be accessed - save progress, Load progress and buy flag.
Using save progress, the user will recieve a .json file.
Opening the file, there is a parameter known as "Clickstore" - which is the value of user's clicks.
Edit this parameter to 9999 - save the file and upload it at the load progress page.
Now head to the buy flag page and buy the flag.
